Weather Dashboard Project: The Weather Dashboard Project demonstrates how Python can be used to integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and visualize it effectively.

The program retrieves key weather parameters such as temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity, processes the data, and displays it using bar charts created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

This project showcases practical skills in API integration, JSON data handling, data processing, and data visualization in a clean and modular Python implementation.
